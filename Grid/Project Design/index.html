            <h3>Every idea üí° starts with a need</h3>
            <p>
              Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
              could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
              wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
              only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
              some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
              thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
              daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
              that the result was just something nice and did not solve any
              problem.

            <h4>Start with asking why</h4>
            <p>
              You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
              effective ways of achieving goals.

            <p>
              Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
              frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

            <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
            <p>
              By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas
              will be fresher and more valuable.

            <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
            <p>
              As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that‚Äôs not
              finished or doesn‚Äôt look perfect. You will learn to accept
              feedback and learn from it.

          The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
          create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the
          result to the community.
